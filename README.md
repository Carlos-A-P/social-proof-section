### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to be more comfortable utilizing css grid and organizing my html to be easily readable. What I was most proud of in this project was how quickly categorised my elements so that I can easily customize them in css

```css
.wrapper {
	max-width: 1200px;
	grid-template-areas:
		"box-1 box-2"
		"box-3 box-3";
	grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
	grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;
}
```

### Questions

- Does my font look ok? I noticed that my h2's may look a little bif or should I leave them as is.
- Is it ok to use rem alot in my projects? I find it easier than px
- What are some different ways to adjust the background images or is this method ok?
- I used the mobile first apporach method in my css, is this a better way of apporaching the project?

### Useful resources

- [Build a Responsive Grid CSS Website Layout From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moBhzSC455o&ab_channel=TraversyMedia) - This helped me understand how to use grids and flexbox to organize my website. I also learned about some new vs code extentions such as prettier which helped make my code look neat and organised.
